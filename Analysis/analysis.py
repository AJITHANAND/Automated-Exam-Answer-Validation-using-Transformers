correct_answer = "an array is a data structure that stores a collection of values, all of the same type, " \
                 "in contiguous memory locations. Each value in an array is identified by an index or a subscript, " \
                 "which is a non-negative integer that represents its position in the array. The index of the first " \
                 "element in an array is typically 0, and the index of the last element is usually one less than the " \
                 "size of the array."
